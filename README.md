beer-guide
==========
________________________________
This project is set up to use Play 2 framework in order to call up information about various beer styles.


Main objectives of this project:

* Help me practice building a complete webapp from backend to user-centric display (main user view)
 * Build a Restful API that allows for netduino-based electonics to utilize information to automate:
   - Temperature automation for homebrew fermentors
   - Temperature and pressure automation for optimal kegerator conditions
 * Practice building clean database implementations with proper refactoring/redirections necessary 
   to test cases with high code-coverage
 * Practice building out frontend technologies, including learning JS


The basic idea that I'll be working towards with this project:
 * initial minimal-formatted output for <hostname>/style
 * secondary formatted output http://<hostname>/style/fermentor to scope output
 * secondary formatted output http://<hostname>/style/kegerator to scope output

Over time, expecation will be that I'll work on my netduino-based kits for interpreting output from server and attaching the necessary electonics to adjust pressure and temperature for the homebrew kits.
Second, I'm hoping to build up to making something presentable for user-facing webapp.
